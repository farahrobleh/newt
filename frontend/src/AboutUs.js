        <SectionTitle>The Challenge</SectionTitle>
        <Paragraph>U.S. research institutions and hospitals often face significant hurdles in efficiently accessing diverse talent. Many talented researchers, whether local or from around the globe, encounter barriers that hinder their ability to connect with opportunities in the U.S. The current recruitment processes are frequently slow and inefficient, resulting in overlooked qualified candidates. This leads to delayed research progress and missed chances for groundbreaking collaborations.</Paragraph>
